        <p>Every time I think of us, it feels like a warm glow inside my chest.
            Every little laugh, every silly joke, every glance we shared — I keep replaying them in my mind.
            Even the moments we were apart, I felt you there with me.</p>

        <p>This page is just for you — a little space where only our memories exist.
            I remember the little things we did, the random texts, the moments that made me smile so hard my stomach
            hurt.
            Even if we’re miles apart, every memory with you feels close and alive.</p>

        <p class="quote">"Our memories shine like stars in the sky, small but infinite, lighting up the nights we spent
            apart."</p>

        <p>Thank you for being my person, for all the little moments that mean the world to me.
            I can’t wait to make more memories with you, no matter where life takes us.</p>

        <p class="signature">With all my heart,<br>Your Khush</p>
